# Feature catalog: build once, include everywhere

The point of `partweave` is that the boilerplate you'd otherwise rewrite in every project lives here
**once**, as a selectable component. You add it with a checkbox (or `--with`), you own the code,
and it's built on swappable interfaces so you can change the implementation without a rewrite.

This page is the menu: what's **available now**, and a concrete **roadmap** of components worth
adding, each written as a mini-spec (what it provides, which apps it touches, what it depends
on), so it can be built by dropping a folder into `modules/`. See
[authoring-a-module.md](authoring-a-module.md) to build one.

## Recommended build order

Roughly in order of leverage, the things nearly every product needs:

1. **`email`**: unblocks verification, password reset, receipts (many features depend on it).
2. **`query`**: the data-fetching layer both clients want; makes `api-client` ergonomic.
3. **`jobs`** + **`cache-redis`**: async work + caching; unblocks webhooks, scheduler, metering.
4. **`payments-stripe`** + **`subscriptions`**: if you're building SaaS.
5. **`push`** / **`notifications`**: engagement for mobile-first products.
6. **`sentry`** + **`logging`** + **`rate-limit`**: production hardening.
7. **`forms`** (pairs with the already-built `ui-kit`): stop rebuilding validation every project.

Everything above is additive: build the ones you need, in any order, and they show up in the
picker for every future project.

## How to get one built

- **Build it yourself**: follow [authoring-a-module.md](authoring-a-module.md); most are a
  `module.json` + a few files, using the `storage` component as the abstract-provider template.
- **Ask**: describe the feature and its target apps, and it can be scaffolded into `modules/`
  following the same contract.
